//! # GRanges: Generic Genomic Range and Data Containers
//!
//! GRanges is a Rust library for working with genomic ranges and their associated data. GRanges
//! also provides a separate command line tool built using this library, which currently
//! implements a subset of the features of other great bioinformatics utilities like
//! [bedtools](https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
//!
//! The idea of GRanges is to facilitate building a new generation of robust, reproducible, and
//! easily installable bioinformatics tools in Rust. It aims to lower the barrier to building
//! simple bioinformatics data processing tools in Rust for biologists that are interested
//! in using the language in their work. Even biologists that have no interest in learning Rust
//! should benefit from Rust-based tools since they are fast. Currently GRanges is engineered
//! as a set of compile-time generic types and methods, though future versions may implement
//! analagous runtime dynamic data structures that would allow the library to be wrapped and used
//! by other languages.
//!
//!
//! ## Design Overview
//!
//! To understand how GRanges could be useful in processing genomic data, it's helpful to first
//! understand the overall design of this software library.
//!
//! Nearly all range data is loaded into GRanges using **parsing iterators** ([parsers]).
//! Parsing iterators read input data from some bioinformatics file format (e.g. `.bed`,
//! `.gtf.gz`, etc) and it then goes down one of two paths:
//!
//!  1. Streaming mode: the entire data set is never read into memory all at once, but rather
//!     is processed entry by entry.
//!
//!  2. In-memory mode: the entire data set *is* read into memory all at once, usually as
//!     a [`GRanges<R, T>`] object. The [`GRanges<R, T>`] object is composed of two parts:
//!     a *ranges container* ([ranges]) and a *data container* ([data]).
//!     [`GRanges`] objects then provide high-level in-memory methods for working with this
//!     genomic data.
//!
//! Both modes then write something to output: a TSV of some statistic calculated on the
//! genomic data, the output of 10 million block bootstraps, or the coefficients of
//! linear regressions run every kilobase on sequence data.
//!
//! The GRanges workflow idea is illustrated in this (super cool) ASCII diagram:
//!
//!
//! ```text
//!   +-------+           +-------------------+           +----------------------+          
//!   | Input |  ----->   |     Iterator      |  ----->   |    GRanges object    | 
//!   +------ +           | (streaming mode)  |           |   (in-memory mode)   |

//!                                 |                                |

//!                                 v                                v            
//!                             +--------+                       +--------+       
//!                             | Output |                       | Output |       
//!                             +--------+                       +--------+       
//!
//! ```
//!
//! Nearly all common data processing and analytics tasks in science can be thought of as taking
//! some raw input data and refining it down some pipeline, until eventually outputting it as some sort of statistical
//! result. Bioinformatics has been built on composing workflows out of command line tools and
//! pipes. Analogously, tidyverse unifies data tidying, summarizing, and modeling by passing data
//! in a datafame down a similar pipeline-based interface. Both operations are simple to use
//! because they compose the same essential *operations* into specific data processing workflows.
//!
//! GRanges is designed to emulate these powerful data analytics tools. It implements core
//! operations on genomic ranges and their associated data, and provides generic, extensible
//! data structures for storing genomic data.
//!
//! GRanges attempts to implement the same core set of data joining and processing tools as the
//! [plyranges](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/plyranges.html) library and
//! R's [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org). It also frames these genomic operations in
//! standard data analytic and database terms. For example, the operation `bedtools intersect -wa -u -a <left>
//! -b <right>` finds all ranges in the *left* set of genomic ranges that overlaps one or more
//! *right* genomic ranges, and reports only the unique left range. This operation is common in
//! many data analytics workflows and database queries, and is known as a *semi join* between a
//! a left table and right table. (see for example this section in Hadley Wickham's book [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/joins.html#filtering-joins)).
//! In the `granges` command line tool, this is implemented in the `granges filter` subcommand. In
//! the library, this subcommand is just the method [`GRanges::filter_overlaps()`].
//!
