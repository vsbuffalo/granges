granges: genomic range operations built off of the GRanges library
usage: granges [--help] <subcommand>

Subcommands:
  
  adjust: Adjust each genomic range, e.g. to add a kilobase to each end.

  filter: Filter the left ranges based on whether they have at least one
          overlap with a right range. This is equivalent to a filtering
          "semi-join" in SQL terminology.
